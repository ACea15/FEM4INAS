* Introduction
This work continues the development of an alternative approach [170, 213–215] to study the
geometrically nonlinear effects of already existing (linear) industrial-scale aeroelastic models.
The method blends the efficiency and accuracy of geometrically-exact 1D descriptions for prob-
lems involving slender components, with the precision of condensation techniques in preserving
the full 3D characteristics. It seamlessly integrates with standard linear aeroelastic analysis
based on finite element solvers and compressible potential aerodynamics. The novelty is that
the geometric-nonlinearity is included by considering information about the nodal coordinates,
which are not tracked in linear modal analysis. The information for the geometric nonlineari-
ties is introduced from the geometric layout of the structure which results in coupling between
modes. This is facilitated by Hodges’ intrinsic equations [216]: by construction, the sectional
velocities and internal forces have local influence regardless of large rigid-body rotations, and
this does not need updating of the local mass and stiffness properties from the initial config-
uration. This feature permits the addition of geometrically-nonlinear effects to a predefined
complex linear model.

This feature permits the addition of geometrically-nonlinear effects to a predefined
complex linear model. In addition, only quadratic terms of the main variables are needed to capture nonlinear effects. Our concern is a problem of relatively high geometrical complexity
for which a (linear) finite-element model (FEM) already exists, not necessarily built with beam
elements, but representing a physical domain with a dominant dimension. The goal is to seek
a computationally-efficient solution strategy that leverages on the slenderness of the domain
to characterise geometrically-nonlinear effects, while utilising the information encapsulated in
the original model –which is built, validated and refined during the design cycle of the specific
engineering asset under consideration.

The resulting solution procedure can be divided into the five stages shown in Fig.: 1) A
linear (arbitrarily complex) model with slender components is the input for the analysis. 2)
Model condensation is employed to derive a skeleton-like substructure, along the main load
path, containing the main features of the full 3D model. 3) The modes of the reduced structure
are evaluated in intrinsic variables (velocities and strains) and used as a basis of a Galerkin-
projection of the geometrically-nonlinear intrinsic beam equations. 4) The projected equations
are solved in time-domain under given forces: aerodynamic influence coefficient matrices are
obtained from DLM and a rational function approximation (RFA) is used to transform to the
time domain. 5) The intrinsic modes, the reduced order transformations, and the nonlinear 1D
solution are combined to reproduce the full 3D solution. Geometrically-nonlinear behaviour
is captured along the principal skeleton and the linear response of the cross-sections (in the
form of ribs and fuselage reinforcements) is also represented –if nonlinear deformations also
occur in the cross-sections, there is no reliable analysis other than high-fidelity solutions of the
full model. The overall procedure has been implemented in what we have named as Nonlinear
Modal Reduced Order Model (NMROM).

** Representative aircraft configurations
A representative FE model of a full aircraft without engines is used to demonstrate the capa-
bilities of the current methodology on large finite-element models where only linear dynamic
analysis would be currently possible. The aircraft’s main wing is composed of wing surfaces,
rear and front spars, wing box and ribs. Flexible tail and rear stabiliser are rigidly attached to
the wing. Isotropic and anisotropic materials are utilised, and the inertia is defined by lumped
masses with interpolation elements connecting it to the structure. Guyan reduction is employed
to condense the model onto the lumped-mass nodes. Fig. 6.1 shows the model built in MSC
Nastran as well as the interpolation elements (RBE3s) connecting master nodes (where the
inertia is given) and slave nodes (in blue).

*** Geometrically nonlinear static response
The static solution of the aircraft is first studied with a NMROM built with the first 50 modes
(Nm = 50) and a tolerance of 1.49 × 10−8 for the nonlinear solver. Follower loads normal to
the wing are applied at each tip of the main wings. The response under loads of 200, 300, 400,
480 and 530 KN is shown in Fig. 6.3. Nonlinear static simulations on the original full model
(before condensation) are also carried out in MSC Nastran and are included in the figure. The
interpolation elements in Nastran are used to output the displacements at the condensation
nodes for direct comparison with the NMROM results. To quantify the difference between both
sets of results, tip displacements, in global coordinates, for the 530 KN load and the full model
calculations are ux = −0.217 m uy = −1.348 m, uz = 7.236 m; while calculations from the
present methodology yield ux = −0.219 m uy = −1.352 m, uz = 7.249 m. This represents an
error of 0.19% for a 25.6% tip deformation of the wing semi-span, b = 28.8 m.
*** Very large nonlinear dynamics
*** Generalised aerodynamic forces
Figure 13 shows a subset of the GAFs for this platform up to $\kappa = 2$ obtained with a sampling of $\delata \kappa = 0.01$. Four
GAFs have been selected, corresponding to the first three wing bending modes and the first torsional mode, and they are
shown in that order in the figure. The same preconditioning scheme of section III has been used, namely, the best fit
to the local values of aerodynamic stiffness, mass and inertia at that limit frequency ($\kappa = 2$). The effect of this is to
reduce the value of the residual transfer function at the highest frequencies in the training dataset, which accelerates
the convergence of the Loewner matrix approach. Figure 13 shows the results for 12 states obtained both with and
without the polynomial preconditioning. As it can be clearly seen, introducing the preconditioning vastly improves the
accuracy of the LTI model of a given size. The Loewner interpolant solution algorithm used in this work does not
enforce stability and in this case all models are unstable.
