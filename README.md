# Finite Element Models 4 Intrinsic Nonlinear Aeroelastic Simulations [FEM4INAS]

FEM4INAS is an aeroelastic toolbox  written and parallelized in Python, which acts as a post-processor of commercial software such as MSC Nastran. 
Arbitrary FE models built for linear aeroelastic analysis are enhanced with geometric nonlinear effects, flight dynamics and linearized state-space solutions about nonlinear equilibrium.
